## Hi there üëã

I am a Data Scientist at [GfK Geomarketing](https://www.gfk.com/home) where I develop new methodology for calculating international market data.<br>
Before, I was working as part of the [Digital Health Geography research group](https://www.geography.nat.fau.eu/research/cultural-geography/wg-digital-health/) as a Data Analyst with focus on machine learning, and the intersection of natural environment and human behavior by developing novel algorithms.<br><br>
On this website I would like to share some of my private projects where I solve geo-spatial problems with R.
