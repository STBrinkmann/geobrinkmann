## Hi :wave:

I’m a Data Scientist at [GfK Geomarketing](https://www.gfk.com/home), specializing in developing methodologies for international market analysis. Previously, I explored the intersection of machine learning, natural environments, and human behavior as part of the [Digital Health Geography research group](https://www.geography.nat.fau.eu/research/cultural-geography/wg-digital-health/).<br>
This site showcases my personal projects, where I tackle geo-spatial challenges using R.
